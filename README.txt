   \State Create multiple of small exact BNs, and rebuild them as one exact BN $\mathcal{G}^*$. 
   \Repeat
   \State Pick up one variable $X_n$ which have no parent set candidates except for $U_{0,n} = \phi$. 
   \State Set some parent set candidates $(U_{\lambda,n})_{\lambda=1}^{\Lambda_n}$ of $X_n$ and each score $(S_n(U_{\lambda,n}))_{\lambda=1}^{\Lambda_n}$ randomly. 
   \State Chose the parent set candidate with minimum score, and add it to $\mathcal{G}^*$. 
   \State If the graph is DAG, then renewal the parent set candidates and the exact BN $\mathcal{G}^*$. 
   \Until{There is no renewal.}
